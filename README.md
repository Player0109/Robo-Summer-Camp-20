# Summer Camp, 2020  
## On Robot Control and simulation - based on PyBullet

   The current edition of the summer camp conducted by the Robotics Club, IIT (BHU)-2020, aims at providing a structured approach towards robot development and control based on the simulation tool PyBullet.This repository will be the primary source of code and content related to the camp.The repository will be updated part wise with subfolders which has the topic wise theory and problem statements/tasks.
   
The file structure of a given part in this repository is as follows:

  * PART - I 
      * SUB PART 1
         * Content and links
         * Task to solve
         * Starter code
      * SUB PART 2
      
      so on ...

   Thus, you are expected to go through all the sub-parts, read the content, and solve all the tasks in order to complete the respective part. The course is divided into 4 such parts and a team project. The successive parts will be updates along during the course of the camp.
   
  This camp is open to all IIT (BHU) students and the entire management and non-technical queries are addressed using a local social group(Whatsapp).

  A more detailed overview of the summer camp structure is provided in this - [pdf](https://github.com/NiranthS/Pybullet-Camp-Part1/blob/master/Camp_Overview.pdf).

**Any queries related to the technical code/content,**
1. Google till you get it ...
2. or, Raise an issue in this repository
3. or, post your problems in the WhatsApp group mentioned
